title: "Microsoft Should Destroy Mogade"
---

<p>I don't believe in Windows Phone. It's obviously been a disappointment for Microsoft, and I'll be surprised if that changes any time soon. One thing I can't tell though is whether Microsoft is serious about the platform and its market. Despite putting themselves in an almost insurmountable position by taking so long to ship, it initially seemed like they were going to give it their all. Now, I'm not so sure.</p>

<p>The message that I'm constantly getting from indie developers is that Microsoft doesn't care about them. The marketplace is a disaster and what little services are available just aren't any good. I don't know if Microsoft doesn't realize how far behind they are, and thus how much more they have to provide, or if they simply don't care.</p>

<p>If I was Microsoft, I'd provide a bunch of free services to indie game developers. Leaderboards, achievements, storage, authentication, real time stats, logging and so on. I'd definitely look at providing better integration to various social platforms, discoverability capabilities and any other promotional service I could think of.</p>

<p>A lot of this stuff is low hanging fruit which wouldn't take that much effort. It could also be tiered into some type of paid account for some of the more successful apps.</p>

<p>I'm sure that, for games anyways, part of the problem is they don't want to compete with their own XBox Live brand. They already have a leaderboard and achievement system, it costs a lot of money to use, and the last thing they want is for simple indie games to dirty the brand. Personally, I think opening XBox Live is inevitable. I'm amazed at it hasn't happened yet.</p>

<p>So consider this an open letter to Microsoft, requesting that they kill mogade. It isn't a challenge, I know there's nothing hard about these services. If they build a free service and commit to helping indie developers build apps, I'll gladly help my users migrate.</p>
