title: "How Meaningful Do You Find Github's Punchcard?"
description: ""
---

<p>A couple weeks ago, we had a little debate about whether or not Github's punchard graph was at all meaningful. I felt strongly that the punchard graph does a good job of highlighting interesting projects and motivated teams; and, as such, could be a rough indicator for a projects likelihood to succeed.</p>

<p>There are some caveats. At best, it's a rough guess. You need to have some insight on the project, such as team size and complexity. You also need to make sure the system isn't being gamed (not all commits are created equally). Still, all things being equal, consider these two projects and tell me which you'd probably rather work on, and which you think is more likely to succeed. Or, assuming you refuse to make any assumption, would the questions you ask each team about their respective project be different?</p>
