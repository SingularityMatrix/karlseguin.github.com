<p>The Little Go Book is a free introduction to Google's Go programming language. It's aimed at developers who might not be quite comfortable with the idea of pointers and static typing. It's longer than the other Little books, but hopefully still captures that <em>little</em> feeling.</p>

<p>You can download the <a href="/assets/go/go.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="/assets/go/go.epub">epub</a> or <a href="/assets/go/go.mobi">mobi</a>

<p>The source, in Markdown, is <a href="http://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-go-book">available on github</a>.</p>
